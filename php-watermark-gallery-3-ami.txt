For all the further labs that involve load-balancers and the php-watermark-gallery application, we will be using a new AMI.

WHY?: As our sessions will be load-balanced between multiple servers we will be using a PHP script that polls the EC2 meta-data and displays as a webpage.

Therefore we will create a new AMI named as php-watermark-gallery-3. This new AMI is created from the base AMI php-watermark-gallery-2

Launch an EC2 instance with php-watermark-gallery-2 AMI in myvpc1 public-1a subnet

Use the below userdata to download the code for aws-metadata-test-page
#/bin/bash
sudo su
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://github.com/tinkrbay/aws-metadata-php-page/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
mv aws-metadata-php-page-master/* /var/www/html/
service httpd restart
In the "add storage" step, select the delete on termination for 1GiB EBS volume
Launch the instance and verify the application

Once done, create an AMI from this instance
AMI Name: php-watermark-gallery-3
Description: Unencrypted AMI for php-watermark-gallery application with 8GiB root volume (delete-on-termination), 1GiB volume (delete-on-termination) hosting the php-watermark-gallery subdirectory and an EFS mounting for the images sub-directory. In addition, there is a aws-metadata-php-page-master script placed in the /var/www/html/ directory for validating loadbalancing actions.
Name-tag the AMI and the corresponding snapshots as php-watermark-gallery-3
