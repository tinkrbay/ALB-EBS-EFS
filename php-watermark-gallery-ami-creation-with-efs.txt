Create a new EFS volume in North Virginia (mount targets in public-1a, public-1b & public-1c subnets of myvpc1)

We will launch 1 EC2 instance with the same AMI php-watermark-gallery-1 

Verify if the application is working appropriately

SSH into the EC2 instance

sudo su
cd /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery

Verify if the images directory exists or not

Next we will mount this images directory onto EFS as an externally shared volume. 

Run the below commands carefully replacing the string efs-dns-name with the dns name of your EFS volume

Do not remove the :/ 

sudo sed -i -- '$ a efs-dns-name:/	/var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/images/	nfs4	nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,_netdev,noresvport	0	0' /etc/fstab
sudo mount -a

TIP: The mounting will take time but should eventually succeed without any error. If there is any error, then we need to troubleshoot

Once mounting is done, we need to verify

You cannot see the EFS mounting via lsblk

Instead you need to execute the command

sudo df -h 

You will see 

If successful mounting occurs, then go ahead and upload some images and validate the application

Once done, Create an AMI with the below details
Name: php-watermark-gallery-2
Description: Unencrypted AMI for php-watermark-gallery application with 8GiB root volume, 1GiB volume hosting the php-watermark-gallery subdirectory and an EFS mounting for the images sub-directory

Once the AMI is available, you can launch an EC2 instance with php-watermark-gallery-2 AMI and verify the application
