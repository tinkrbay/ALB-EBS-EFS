Create a new EFS volume in North Virginia
The mount targets will be in public-1a, public-1b & public-1c subnets of myvpc1
Add the tags with Key: Name and Value: php-watermark-gallery-images

We will launch 1 EC2 instance with the same AMI php-watermark-gallery-1 

Verify if the application is working appropriately

SSH into the EC2 instance

sudo su
cd /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery

Verify if the images directory exists or not

Next we will mount this images directory onto EFS as an externally shared volume. 

Run the below commands carefully to mount the EFS volume.

Keep your EFS DNS name handy in a notepad

vi /etc/fstab and then press shift+G and then shift+A. Hit enter to go a new last line

Insert the below line. Do not remove the :/ 

efs-dns-name:/	/var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/images/	nfs4	nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,_netdev,noresvport	0	0

Next take your curson and change the efs-dns-name string with the actual dns name of your EFS volume
Save the file via Esc + Shift : + wq!

Then mount the EFS using the below command

sudo mount -a

TIP: The mounting will take time but should eventually succeed without any error. If there is any error, then we need to troubleshoot

Once mounting is done, we need to verify

You cannot see the EFS mounting via lsblk

Instead you need to execute the command

sudo df -h 

You will see an output indicating the EFS mounting

If successful mounting occurs, then go ahead and upload some images and validate the application

Once done, Create an AMI with the below details
Name: php-watermark-gallery-2
Description: Unencrypted AMI for php-watermark-gallery application with 8GiB root volume, 1GiB volume hosting the php-watermark-gallery subdirectory and an EFS mounting for the images sub-directory

Once the AMI is available, you can launch an EC2 instance with php-watermark-gallery-2 AMI and verify the application
